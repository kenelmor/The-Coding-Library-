It should involve at least 3 classes written by the team members, 4 if the team has 4 members, and some testing code. Each team member should fully write at least one class. Please have a comment at the beginning of every class with the team name and contributing team member name.
It should involve complex data structures such as arrays and/or linked lists. Use of the library classes ArrayList and Arrays is allowed.
It should have at least a minimal graphical user interface, such as we will discuss later in the semester.
The source code (.java files) should be uploaded to a team project in GitHub, as well as a stand-alone executable jar file. See the instructions or the file C211_JarFile.pdf in the Course Resources and Module 14 modules on Canvas.
All the participants should have a GitHub account and be added as collaborators to the project in GitHub.
The project should contain a README file describing the project aim, the source files and their purpose, the interface functionality, and anything else the user might need to run the application. You should also credit each contributor for their work in the README file, as well as anyone or any site you used for resources (graphics, sound files, and so on).
If you use an online tutorial, cite the tutorial in the documentation, and also write down what you did add to the resources provided by the tutorial. The 3 classes mentioned above should be created in addition to the files that you obtained from the tutorial.
Since jar files don't always work and I may not have time to recreate your project locally to test it, please take some screen shots of the running application and upload them to the GitHub repository along with the rest of the project files. Creating a folder for them in the repository under a name like "media" is a good idea.
